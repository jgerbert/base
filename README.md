# Typography-First Website Template

A handcrafted, modern website template designed with a strong focus on typography, modular layout, visual clarity, and performance. Built from the ground up with semantic HTML, logical class-based CSS, and custom design tokensâ€”this template avoids framework bloat while adhering to responsive design and accessibility standards.

## Typography System

This template features a sophisticated typography system using a high-end Google Fonts pairing:

- **Headings:** [Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display) - An elegant serif typeface with beautiful contrast and classical proportions
- **Body:** [Plus Jakarta Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Plus+Jakarta+Sans) - A versatile, modern sans-serif with excellent readability and comprehensive multilingual support

This pairing creates a sophisticated, professional aesthetic suitable for design agencies, studios, and creative businesses while maintaining excellent readability and accessibility.

## Core Design Goals

- **Typography-first** philosophy rooted in journalistic standards (optimal line-length, vertical rhythm, fluid scale).
- **Responsive design** from **360px (mobile)** to **1920px+ (desktop)** using fluid containers and adaptive breakpoints.
- **Built-in Light/Dark Mode** with both `prefers-color-scheme` and a manual override toggle.
- **Grid-aligned vertical and horizontal layout**, locked to a base spacing unit (8px baseline).
- **Logical, minimal class structure**â€”not class-less, but sensibly classed and reusable.
- **No framework dependencies**â€”CSS is fully custom and cleanly organized.
- **Robust design token system** used throughout for consistency and easy customization.
- **Accessibility-first (a11y)** with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
- **Minimal JavaScript**, limited to essential interactivity only (theme switching, modals, etc.).
